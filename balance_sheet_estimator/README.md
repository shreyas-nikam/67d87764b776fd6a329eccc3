## Expected Outcomes of Mock Tests

When running the mock tests, the following outcomes are expected:

1. **Financial Metric Calculations:**
   - Total Financial Wealth: Expected to be **$250,000**.
   - Estimated Human Capital: Expected to be **$1,680,000**.
   - Estimated Liabilities: Expected to be approximately **$1,293,600**.
   - Estimated Net Worth: Calculated based on total wealth minus estimated liabilities.

2. **User Input Handling:**
   - After simulating user input collection, the session state is expected to contain `user_inputs`, confirming proper data retention.

3. **Visualization Logic Execution:**
   - The visualization logic should execute successfully without rendering errors, confirming the robustness of the plotting functionality.

### Execution for Confirmation
To confirm these functionalities and ensure complete operability, please run the `mock_test_execution.py` file within the `tests` directory. Ensure your environment accommodates the necessary Streamlit contextual imports for accurate simulations.
